# Discord bot for MyStat

Just dicord bot for MyStat system. Also great (not so) example how to use My MyStat SDK (if You can call it that)

# Features

  - View how much homework you need to do.
  - And view how long teachers review homework.
  - View you place in group and class.
  - More features later 

### Tech side

My project use [this](https://github.com/CharlotteDunois/Livia) framework and require :

- BcMath library (used by framework)
- MySql database
- My MyStat SDK 

### Just some very funny (not) features (for me)

-  Bot MUST be at least in one guild. [Issue](https://github.com/CharlotteDunois/Yasmin/issues/128) about this
-  Also make `composer install` on server (but upload "custom" livia lib)
-  And if you need to post multiline output use ''' ''' 
-  One more (I think) feature : must add debug output to prevent bot from sticking  when no args passed to commands that need them
-  And yeah "custom" Livia becouse of deleted commands 
### What I`m use
What i`m use to develop this (and other [projects](https://github.com/users/Nereg/projects/1))? There is list:

- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
